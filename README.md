# Calculus-III-Scripts
A repository of all the MATLAB scripts that I wrote to do a college calculus III course for me.
The majority of them are either for specific homeworks or are helper functions made for homeworks.

The majority of these can be repurposed by simply changing the inputs at the beginning of each code chunk.
